# PathFinding
Based on `theta*` alg. Alg implemented in C++, but there is a binding to Python pybind11.</br>
Tested only on linux. You can find built LazyThetaStart library, but there is some problems of porting prebuild library from one linux platform to another. So you may need to compile lib. </br>
